# MatMOD
Finding the minimum convex hull (MCH) in a rectangle using the Graham and Jarvis methods.


The program contains an algorithm that:
⦁ Accepts a number entered by the user as input.
⦁ The user selects one of three methods for graphically displaying the generated points: uniform distribution, Gaussian distribution, uniform distribution within a circle. The program draws a given number of points on a plane.
⦁ The program finds the minimum convex hull using the Graham and Jarvis methods, and also displays the execution time.
⦁ Test the program on different amounts of data and data queries. Analyze the obtained results of calculations with different initial data. Create a report using visual graphs and tables displaying the results of the work.

# INSTRUCTIONS
Enter the number of points.

Select the method for distributing the points.

The points will be randomly displayed on the plane taking into account the distribution.
